# W-rl-cks
A multiplayer game based largely off of a mod of another game.
The files uploaded are the ones I have created, there are others which may be necessary for proper use of the application not included.

Note: Some variable names have been changed in these uploads, I doubt it would cause a problem, but I haven't tested this version.
Online capabilities requires another file not included.
